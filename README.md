# Employee Attrition Prediction

This is my final project for Data Science Course at Purwadhika Startup and Coding School. From this project you can predict which employee that likely to resign from the company using machine learning model.

The data that being used in this project is from IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/kernels). 
There are 35 variables of employee analytics with some of the variable is categorical such as:

1. **Education**: 1='Below College' 2='College' 3='Bachelor' 4='Master' 5='Doctor'

2. **EnvironmentSatisfaction**: 1='Low' 2='Medium' 3='High' 4='Very High'

3. **JobInvolvement**: 1='Low' 2='Medium' 3='High' 4='Very High'

4. **JobSatisfaction**: 1='Low' 2='Medium' 3='High' 4='Very High'

5. **PerformanceRating**: 1='Low' 2='Good' 3='Excellent' 4='Outstanding'

6. **RelationshipSatisfaction**: 1='Low' 2='Medium' 3='High' 4='Very High'

7. **WorkLifeBalance**: 1='Bad' 2='Good' 3='Better' 4='Best'
